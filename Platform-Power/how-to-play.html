            There are a total of 9 platforms for each team, which consist of:
            <ul>
                <li>Power source</li>
                <li>Sandstone</li>
                <li>Redstone</li>
                <li>Skeletons (for arrows)</li>
                <li>Armour and Weapons</li>
                <li>Food & Ladders</li>
                <li>Misc Items (invisibility potions, enchanting, etc.)</li>
                <li>2 platforms OF FIREBALLS</li>
            </ul>

            There is also an additional island at the center of all the teams
            which spawns stone bricks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Operators are able to control the lobby settings by standing on the
            button in the middle of the lobby and pressing the button in order
            to get the control book, this book also is what allows you to start
            the game.

            Your goal is to protect your bed and to eliminate your opponents.
            Simple. Right?

            <h2>Helpful Hints:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There is additional redstone in the hopper at the redstone
                    island.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can move the hopper to any island that you want more
                    resources from.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is a nice spot on the skeleton island for your bed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you lose your bed, you can steal another team's and put
                    it in the same spot as your bed and it will still let you
                    respawn.

            What the control book allows you to change and do are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Start the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Become an operator in the game's eyes. (Can make anyone an
                    operator by adding the <code>op</code> tag to them via the
                    <code>/tag playerName add op</code> command, this will
                    allow them to use the entire control book)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow each of the teams to be played (Independant control).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Disallow each of the teams to played (Independant control).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enable and disable barriers for each team so that you can
                    use team captains.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add random players to each of the teams (Independant control).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a ladder to each of the team's barriers so people can go
                    into the team area but not out of it.
                </li>
