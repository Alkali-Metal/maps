                <h2>Version 1.4.0</h2>
                Changes in version 1.4.0:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Changed player detection from team based to effect
                        based. This prevents players leaving in the middle of a
                        game from stopping the game from finishing. This means
                        that everyone in the game will always have the <code>
                        minecraft:unluck</code> effect, this does not impact
                        gameplay at all, it is just a method to be able to see
                        all players in the game for each team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Updated the list of blocks that the game uses to clear
                        the map, this should prevent and rogue blocks from
                        slipping through the reset system that is in place.
                        The added tags are <code>minecraft:block_list</code>
                        and <code>minecraft:wall_signs</code> (overwritting
                        default)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the game you will be teleported back to the zone
                        in the lobby for the team you were on. (Ex: Someone on
                        the green team will be teleported back to the green
                        circle in the lobby). This makes it easier to play with
                        the same teams multiple times in a row if desired.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added a debug function, can give you information by
                        running <code>/function classic:debug</code>, this will
                        give you important information for when you are
                        requesting help or reporting a bug.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Version 1.3.0</h2>
                Changes in version 1.3.0:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spectators now see blocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spectators now get put into spectator mode when the game
                        starts rather than survival.

                    <li>
                        Added a visual indicator of what the button does in the
                        middle of the lobby.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Updates <code>README.txt</code> to include how to get
                        the control book and start the game.
