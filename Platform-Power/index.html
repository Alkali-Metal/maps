            Platform Power is a team based PVP minigame where the goal is to
            keep your team from being eliminated and to eliminate the other
            teams. You can keep your team alive by securing your bed and
            powering the platforms for your team to gain resources and helpful
            advantages over the other teams, but if the other teams get them
            powered first you may be at risk of elimination sooner than wanted.
            These platforms are used to gain the resources needed to win and to
            fend off the other teams. This minigame supports between 2-4 teams
            each with at least 1 player per team. Download at the bottom of this
            page.
