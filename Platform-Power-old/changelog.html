                <h2>Version 1.5.2</h2>
                Changes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Remove thrown menu prompts from the world.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add an error message for when not all of the teams are
                        ready and someone tries to start the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Change from a chat message to a title that the game is
                        starting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a <code>control</code> menu item for force-starting
                        the game regardless of pre-game checks. This should
                        rarely be used, but can be used if people on teams are
                        being annoying and not ready-ing up after a while.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                Bug Fixes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fix preventing the game from occasionally starting due
                        to weird behaviour with the team enable/disable functions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixes edge case if all players died at the same time (or
                        the game was only started with no one on an actual team)
                        it will no longer hang in a perma-end state.
                    </li>
                    <li hidden>
                        Adds a tag to the fireballs that get summoned to prevent
                        them from flickering in and out of existance as that was
                        super annoying.
                    </li>

                <h2>Version 1.5.1</h2>
                Changes in version 1.5.1:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the recommended server properties to the archive.</li>

                <h2>Version 1.5.0</h2>
                Changes in version 1.5.0:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added support for Minecraft 1.15.2
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Made the game controls much cleaner by using an inventory
                        menu rather than a command book. This prevents players
                        from needing to add the <code>op</code> tag to
                        themselves and allows a more seamless experience for
                        everyone. The menu includes a prompt for the hotbar
                        that displays the keybind the user has the open
                        inventory key set to.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added team randomization options.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spectator is now not the default team. Unless the game
                        has started, in which case everyone without a team will
                        be put onto the spectator team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To restrict menu control to those who are event
                        organizers you can run <code>/tag @s add control</code>
                        as the user who wants control. This tag can be given to
                        as many players as desired. This also exposes an extra
                        setting to remove everyone from all teams.

                <h2>Version 1.4.0</h2>
                Changes in version 1.4.0:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Changed player detection from team based to effect
                        based. This prevents players leaving in the middle of a
                        game from stopping the game from finishing. This means
                        that everyone in the game will always have the <code>
                        minecraft:unluck</code> effect, this does not impact
                        gameplay at all, it is just a method to be able to see
                        all players in the game for each team.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Updated the list of blocks that the game uses to clear
                        the map, this should prevent any rogue blocks from
                        slipping through the reset system that is in place.
                        The added tags are <code>minecraft:block_list</code>
                        and <code>minecraft:wall_signs</code> (overwritting
                        default)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the game you will be teleported back to the zone
                        in the lobby for the team you were on. (Ex: Someone on
                        the green team will be teleported back to the green
                        circle in the lobby). This makes it easier to play with
                        the same teams multiple times in a row if desired.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added a debug function, can give you information by
                        running <code>/function classic:debug</code>, this will
                        give you important information for when you are
                        requesting help or reporting a bug.

                Changes in version 1.3.0:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spectators now see blocks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spectators now get put into spectator mode when the game
                        starts rather than survival.

                    <li>
                        Added a visual indicator of what the button does in the
                        middle of the lobby.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Updates <code>README.txt</code> to include how to get
